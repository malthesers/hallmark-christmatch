## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

The grid contains **20** clickable cards those being **10** pairs of Hallmark Christmas movie covers for you to match.

Start by clicking a card to flip it face-up revealing the movie cover, then click a new card to reveal it and see if they are the same movie.

Proceed through all the cards as you memorise the location of the different movies, so you eventually will be able to match them all.

## ðŸŽ¥ Movies

There are **28** *unique* movies released from 2015 through 2020.

Each time a game is started, 10 movies will be randomly chosen for that game.

Will you be able to properly distinguish them all?
